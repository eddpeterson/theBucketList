## Design
* LOGO: Things I'd like to do before I kick the bucket
* Design needs to be warm and simple
* Icons for menu, but Friends menu item functionality will go under Timeline so menu item image should display it (kind of my and my friends timeline)
### About page
* Should display facebook friends using the application if you are logged in to facebook
* Place for video 
* Note that when user is logged in to facebook in browser, but not in application, he/she sees friends using website

### Goals page
* Add icons to Personal, Family, Friends, Work, Social (big icon on top and small icons near each of the goals)
* Add kind of recycle bin icon instead of Remove button
* Change "Add" button to something other? 
* Emphasize those frames, that have more items than others (if Friends have more goals than Work, it should be visible to user)

### Timeline page
* Use goals small icons
* Create status indicator (completed or not completed goal). Nice button that slides like here: http://www.heroku.com/pricing#0-0+shared

### N% goals completeness
* Like LinkedIn when you go to edit profile

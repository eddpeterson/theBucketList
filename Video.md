Commitment!!!
Make a commitment, work hard on it and the accomplishment of what matters to you will be the ultimate prize there is!

Goals page!!!
Personal time, family, friends, career and social life and you got only 24 hours. 
6h a day you sleep. (If you sleep more than Arnold Schwartn would recommend you sleep faster)

8h or more a day you work (If you work less - congratulations, you must be from Norway) 
2h a day you eat.
2h a day you travel from work to home.

That leaves you with 6 hours.
We believe urgent activities distract you form what is truly important to you so be smart on how you use those 6 hours.  
Visualize the center of your attention and verify if that is how you want to be perceived. 


Timeline page!!!
Part of commitment is expectations of when!



See about page!!!!

    Timeline assists you to keep focus on your goals as months passes by. You first look at the next 10 months important goals you want to achieve. You also set your future goals for the next 10+ years and as the time passes history will be made. Would not it be interesting to see your grandfathers timeline of his most important accomplished and unreached goals? To see king of the pop goals that helped him become popular?

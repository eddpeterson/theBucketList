# Feature: Bucket list 
#   In order to add new items to bucket list
#   As a website visitor
#   I want to be able to fill in title and due date of a new item
# 
#   Scenario: Add new todo
#     Given I am on the home page
#     When I fill in "title" with "Travel to Thaiti"
#     And I fill in "due_date" with "1/1/2020"
#     And I press "Add"
#     Then I should see "Travel to Thaiti added to your bucket list"
